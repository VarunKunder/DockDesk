DockDesk - Your Personal Homelab Dashboard DockDesk is a modern, responsive, and feature-rich dashboard for monitoring and managing your personal homelab server. Built with a React frontend and a Node.js backend, it provides a clean interface to control your Docker containers, manage files, monitor system resources, and even handle your music library, all from a single place.✨ FeaturesDockDesk is packed with powerful widgets to give you full control over your server:📊 System Stats:View real-time, accurate CPU usage, RAM usage, and disk space utilization.Monitor your server's CPU temperature to ensure optimal performance.Data is fetched live from the server's OS for 100% accuracy.🐳 Docker Management:See a live list of all your Docker containers and their current status (running, exited, etc.).Start, stop, and restart any container directly from the dashboard.The container list is scrollable to maintain a clean layout, no matter how many containers you have.🔧 Services Grid:Add and monitor the status of all your self-hosted services (e.g., Nextcloud, Jellyfin).The dashboard automatically checks if each service is online or offline.📂 File Browser:Securely browse a specified directory on your homelab server (e.g., a mounted hard drive).Navigate through folders and download files directly from the dashboard.The backend is "jailed" to a specific root directory for security, preventing access to sensitive system files.🎵 Music Player & Spotify Downloader:A fully functional music player that streams and plays songs directly from your server's music folder.Includes playback controls (play/pause, skip), a seekable progress bar, and a volume/mute control.Search your downloaded music library in real-time.Features a Spotify Downloader: paste any Spotify playlist URL to download the songs directly to your music folder using spotdl, with live progress logs streamed to the dashboard.🛠️ Tech StackThis project uses a modern and robust set of technologies:Frontend (React + Vite)Framework: React with TypeScriptBuild Tool: ViteUI Components: shadcn/uiStyling: Tailwind CSSIcons: Lucide ReactReal-time Communication: Socket.IO ClientBackend (Node.js + Express)Framework: Express.js with TypeScriptSystem Stats: systeminformation library for accurate, cross-platform hardware data.Docker Control: dockerode to securely interact with the Docker engine.Command Execution: Secure child_process.spawn for running spotdl.Real-time Communication: Socket.IODeploymentContainerization: Docker & Docker Compose🚀 Setup & Installation (Production on Homelab Server)Follow these steps to get DockDesk running on your Ubuntu/Debian-based homelab server.1. PrerequisitesEnsure your server has the following installed:GitDocker & Docker Compose (sudo apt-get install -y docker.io docker-compose-plugin)Python & Pip (sudo apt-get install -y python3-pip)spotdl (pip install spotdl)2. Get the CodeClone the repository onto your server:git clone [https://github.com/VarunKunder/DockDesk.git](https://github.com/VarunKunder/DockDesk.git)
cd DockDesk
3. Configure the ApplicationThe entire application is configured using the docker-compose.yml file. Open it with a text editor (nano docker-compose.yml) and verify the volume paths on the left side of the colon (:) match your server's setup./mnt/hdd: The path to the hard drive you want to browse and monitor./mnt/hdd/docker/navidrome/music: The path to your music library.4. Build and RunRun the following command from the root of the project directory:sudo docker compose up --build -d
--build: This will build the frontend and backend Docker images.-d: This runs the application in the background.Your dashboard is now live! You can access it by going to http://<your-server-ip>:8080.💻 DevelopmentTo run the project on your local machine (e.g., a Windows laptop) for development, follow these steps.1. Backend SetupNavigate to the /backend directory.Install dependencies: yarn installCreate a .env file and add your server's Tailscale IP:DOCKER_HOST=100.x.y.z
In package.json, update the dev script with the correct paths for your server:"dev": "cross-env FILE_BROWSER_ROOT=/mnt/hdd SPOTDL_OUTPUT_PATH=/mnt/hdd/docker/navidrome/music STATS_DISK_PATH=/mnt/hdd ts-node-dev -r dotenv/config --respawn --transpile-only src/index.ts"
Run the backend: yarn dev2. Frontend SetupNavigate to the /frontend directory.Install dependencies: yarn installRun the frontend: yarn devThe frontend will be available at http://localhost:8080 (or as specified by Vite) and will connect to the backend running on localhost:3001.
